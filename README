Numerical Processing Library

The purpose of this library is to serve as a prototype until I have time to develop the fully-native library. My goal is to develop the framework in C++, and the subroutines in C, Fortran, and Assembly language. The goal of this library is a combination of power with performance, both in terms of memory and power consumption. I've been working on some FASM programs and I've been able to reduce the size of executables by a factor of about 50 as opposed to similar programs compiled with MSVC or GCC. I don't have too much time to work on this right now though, so for the time being I'm just working on getting the main features functional.
